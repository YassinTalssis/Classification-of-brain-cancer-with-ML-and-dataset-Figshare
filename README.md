# Classification-of-brain-cancer-with-ML-and-dataset-Figshare

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of brain cancer. Brain cancer is a complex and challenging disease, and accurate classification can significantly impact treatment decisions and patient outcomes. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to assist in the diagnosis and prediction of brain cancer subtypes based on medical imaging data.

To accomplish this, a dataset containing brain cancer imaging data is utilized.
